# We have moved!	
#### We are now part of the Monero-Ecosystem group of repositories and as active as ever.
#### [Join us at our new location here](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/PiNode-XMR)

##### For our current users your device will function as normal. Your next PiNode-XMR update will change your external links to point to the new repository.
###### Once sufficient time has been given to update devices, code will be removed from this repository leaving just this title page. Est Jul 2020.
